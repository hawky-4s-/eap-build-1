eap-build
=========

ATTENTION: This is work in progress and does not work yet!!!!

This perl script is meant to build jboss eap6. Here are the commands to run:

git clone https://github.com/mbogner/eap-build.git
cd eap-build
./build.pl --clean

Many thanks to Alexis Hassler (@AlexisHassler) who wrote scripts for the last versions and whose work I'm basing on.
